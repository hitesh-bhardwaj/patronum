                                <p>This technology is used to trigger tailored advertising across the internet to individuals who have shown interest in our business and visited our website. Google AdWords Remarketing functions by serving relevant ads that are tailored to you based upon the specific pages you have visited whilst on the BESPIN LABS website, by placing a cookie onto your computer or device.</p>
                                <p>This cookie will not give us any type of access or control of your computer or device, nor will it provide us with any personally identifiable information.</p>
                                <p>These cookies are used by Google AdWords Remarketing to tag an individual who has visited a specific page on our website and to display ads on third party websites (including Google) related to that page, the purpose being to help us deliver a tailored experience and related marketing materials to more accurately fit your needs, essentially ensuring you only see ads that are relevant to you.</p>
                                <p>These ads can appear in places such as Google search results, or a site that’s part of the Google Display Network. Any data collected will be done so in line with our own privacy policy.</p>

                                <p>Should you choose to contact us using the contact form or by requesting for white papers or case studies to be sent to you, or by sending an email directly to one of our employees’ emails that are stated on the website, none of the data that you supply will be stored by this website or passed to / be processed by any of the third party data processors defined in section 6.</p>
                                <p>Instead the data will be collated into an email and sent over the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Our SMTP servers are protected by TLS (sometimes known as SSL) meaning that the email content is encrypted using SHA-2, 256-bit cryptography before being sent across the internet. The email content is then decrypted by our local computers and devices.</p>

                                <p>Your data will remain within these parties’ database for as long as we continue to use their services or until you specifically request removal. You can do this by requesting removal via email.

                                <p>LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings.</p>
