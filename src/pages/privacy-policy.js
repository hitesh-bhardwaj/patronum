                  <strong>Google Analytics</strong>
                  <br />
                  Google Analytics records data such as your geographical
                  location, device, internet browser and operating system,
                  however none of this information personally identifies you to
                  us. Google Analytics also records your computer’s IP address
                  which could be used to personally identify you, but Google
                  does not grant us access to this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Google Analytics makes use of cookies, details of which can be
                  found on Google’s developer guides. Disabling cookies on your
                  internet browser will stop Google Analytics from tracking any

                  <strong>LinkedIn Analytics</strong>
                  <br />
                  Our websites may make use of the LinkedIn Conversion Tracking
                  tool and Insight Tag. These tools are part of an analytics
                  service provided by LinkedIn Corporation that connects data
                  from the LinkedIn advertising network with actions performed
                  on this website. These features track visitor data through the
                  use of cookies by collecting data regarding LinkedIn members’
                  visits to our website, including the URL, referrer, IP
                  address, device and browser characteristics, timestamp, and
                  page views.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This data is encrypted, then de-identified within seven days,
                  and the de-identified data is deleted within 90 days. LinkedIn
                  does not share the personal data with us, it only provides
                  aggregated reports about a website audience and ad
                  performance. LinkedIn also provides retargeting for each
                  website’s visitors, enabling the website owner to show
                  personalized ads on its website by using this data, but
                  without identifying the member.
                </p>
                <p>
                  None of the information gathered is personally identifiable
                  and is used for the specific purpose of providing more
                  personalized ad content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  LinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data
                  for advertising purposes through their account settings.

                  <strong>Exercising your rights</strong>
                  <br />
                  As a data subject whose personal information is held by us,
                  you have certain rights. If you wish to exercise any of these
                  rights, please email <a href="mailto:privacy@bespinlabs.com">privacy@bespinlabs.com</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to process your request, we will ask you to provide
                  valid forms of identification for verification purposes.

                <p>
                  <strong>The right to be informed</strong>
                  <br />
                  You may request a copy of the personal data we hold about you
                  free of charge. Once we have verified your identity and, if
                  relevant, the authority of any third-party requester, we will
                  provide access to the personal data we hold about you as well
                  as the following information:
                  <br />
                  • The purposes of the processing
                  <br />
                  • The categories of personal data concerned
                  <br />
                  • The recipients to whom the personal data has been disclosed
                  <br />
                  • The retention period or envisioned retention period for that
                  personal data
                  <br />• When personal data has been collected from a third
                  party, the source of the personal data
                </p>
                <p>
                  If there are exceptional circumstances that mean we can refuse
                  to provide the information, we will explain them. If requests
                  are frivolous or vexatious, we reserve the right to refuse
                  them. If answering requests is likely to require additional
                  time or occasions unreasonable expense (which you may have to
                  meet), we will inform you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The right to rectification</strong>
                  <br />
                  When you believe we hold inaccurate or incomplete personal
                  information about you, you may exercise your right to correct
                  or complete this data. This may be used with the right to
                  restrict processing to make sure that incorrect/incomplete
                  information is not processed until it is corrected
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>
                    The right to erasure (the ‘right to be forgotten’)
                  </strong>
                  <br />
                  Where no overriding legal basis or legitimate reason continues
                  to exist for processing personal data, you may request that we
                  delete the personal data. This includes personal data that may
                  have been unlawfully processed. We will take all reasonable
                  steps to ensure erasure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The right to restrict processing</strong>
                  <br />
                  You may ask us to stop processing your personal data. We will
                  still hold the data but will not process it any further. This
                  right is an alternative to the right to erasure. If one of the
                  following conditions applies you may exercise the right to
                  restrict processing:
                  <br />
                  • The accuracy of the personal data is contested
                  <br />
                  • Processing of the personal data is unlawful
                  <br />
                  • We no longer need the personal data for processing, but the
                  personal data is required for part of a legal process
                  <br />• The right to object has been exercised and processing
                  is restricted pending a decision on the status of the
                  processing
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The right to data portability</strong>
                  <br />
                  You may request your set of personal data be transferred to another controller or processor, provided in a commonly used and machine-readable format. This right is only available if the original processing was on the basis of consent, the processing is by automated means and if the processing is based on the fulfillment of a contractual obligation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The right to object</strong>
                  <br />
                  You have the right to object to our processing of your data where:
                  <br />
                  • Processing is based on legitimate interest
                  <br />
                  • Processing is for the purpose of direct marketing
                  <br />
